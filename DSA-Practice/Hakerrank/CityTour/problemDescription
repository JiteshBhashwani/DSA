Problem
A vertex is considered as a point with both its coordinates as integers.

You are initially at the origin of a 2D surface. You can move by the following rules:

One move is counted as a vertex to an adjacent vertex. You cannot jump, and can only move to an adjacent vertex. For example, if you are at point A(x,y) , then you may move to any of the points  B, C, D, E (defined below),
                   A(x,y)  to  B(x,y-1) or C(x,y+1) or D(x+1,y) or E(x-1,y)

 

Distance from origin should increase with each move.
                   Distance from origin for a vertices (a,b) is:

   Dis(a,b) = abs(a)+abs(b) where abs() is absolute value.

 
**Both the rules should be satisfied for each move.**
 

For a given number of steps (N), calculate the count of possible final position vertices you may end in if you initially started from the origin.

Explanation
For first test case, the set of possible points are (3,0),(2,1),(1,2),(-3,0),(-2,1),(-1,2),(0,3),(2,-1),(1,-2),(0,-3),(-2,-1) and (-1,-2), i.e. total of 12 points possible.

For second test case, the set of possible points are (1,0),(-1,0),(0,1) and (0,-1), i.e. total of 4 points possible.
