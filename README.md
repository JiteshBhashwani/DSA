# JiteshBhashwani/DSA

This is a repository to track the progress of my data structures and algorithms (DSA) learning journey. I am following various online courses, books and websites to learn and practice DSA concepts and problems.

The repository contains the following directories:

- `datastructures`: This directory contains implementations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc. in C++.
- `algorithms`: This directory contains implementations of various algorithms such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking, etc. in C++.
- `problems`: This directory contains solutions to various DSA problems from different platforms such as LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeChef, etc. in C++.

**Note: This repository is still in progress and I am currently adding more content as I am learning. Some content may be in Java instead of C++.**


## Motivation

I created this repository to document my learning process and to showcase my skills and knowledge in DSA. I believe that DSA is an essential topic for any software engineer or programmer who wants to solve complex problems efficiently and elegantly. I also enjoy learning new things and challenging myself with different types of problems.

## Resources
