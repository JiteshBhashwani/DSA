## Motivation

I created this repository to practice and improve my problem-solving skills using data structures and algorithms. I also wanted to share my solutions with other learners who might find them helpful or interesting.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need a C++ compiler and an IDE of your choice. You can also use an online compiler like https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler.

## Usage

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a source of problems, such as LeetCode or HackerRank. Inside each folder, you will find subfolders for different topics or categories, such as arrays or strings. Each subfolder contains one or more C++ files with the problem statement and my solution.

You can run any file by compiling it with your C++ compiler and executing it. For example:

```bash
g++ arrays/maximum_subarray.cpp -o maximum_subarray
./maximum_subarray 
```
Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code into an online compiler and run it there.
